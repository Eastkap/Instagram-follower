Open Source project (need to take a look of the license tho). This project aims to make a stable mass follower and unfollower on Instagram.

Basically this is the first public push. Code needs to be reworked and refactored.

Adapted to the latest Instagram API changes. First run will ask you settings, it will create a config.txt, which is a json object. Each element in the JSON array will be a task. It can run unlimited tasks, just copy paste & change.

First run on a new account will open a Chrome window to log in, then save the cookies so it's no longer required. This allows to do several things, for instance run first time on Desktop and then on a CLI server.
